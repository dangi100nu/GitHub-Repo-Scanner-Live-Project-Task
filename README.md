GitHub Repository Scanner:-

This project features a powerful GitHub repository scanner that allows users to search and explore repositories with ease. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless experience.

Frontend:

      . Built using React and styled with Bootstrap for a user-friendly and responsive interface.
      . Utilizes GraphQL with Apollo Client to efficiently query and retrieve repository data.
      . Provides an intuitive user interface for searching and browsing repositories.
      
Backend:

      . Developed with Node.js for robust server-side functionality.
      . Implements a GraphQL server with Apollo Server to handle data requests efficiently.
      . Supports various GraphQL queries to fetch detailed information about repositories.


There are the Client Requirements:-

Given below is the assignment for Node JS/React. 
Please see the assignment details. You will need to implement a "GitHub scanner" system.

General:

1. Please clone the following repo 
https://github.com/roma8389/javascript

Import the above repo to your own GitHub account under 3 different names (for example repoA, repoB, repoC) 
Note: you can open a GitHub project for free ( Use your personal email id while creating a GitHub project).


2. Create an Apollo GraphQL server 

3. The server needs to support 2 scenarios 

      .     Show a List of Repositories 
      .      Show Repo details 

Make sure to add to your input a "developer token" from GitHub and return the appropriate data for the scenario

The list of Repositories should contain the following information:

      · Repo name

      · Repo size

      · Repo owner

Repo details should contain the following information:

     · Repo name

     · Repo size

     · Repo owner

     · Private\public repo

    · Number of files in the repo

    · Content of 1 yml file (anyone that appears in the repo)

    · Ative webhooks

Notes:
1. The system should be working as expected and convenient
2. Keep clean code and proper functionality
3. When scanning all 3 repos at the same time limit your code to scan up to maximum 2 repos in parallel 

Bonus:
Implement a client application to display the list of Repo's and the content of the repo once selected
