Given below is the assignment for Node JS. Please complete the assignment in 2 Days.
Please see the assignment details. You will need to implement a "GitHub scanner" system.

General:

1. Please clone the following repo 
https://github.com/roma8389/javascript

Import the above repo to your own GitHub account under 3 different names (for example repoA, repoB, repoC) 
Note: you can open a GitHub project for free ( Use your personal email id while creating a GitHub project).


2. Create an Apollo GraphQL server 

3. The server needs to support 2 scenarios 

      .     Show a List of Repositories 
      .      Show Repo details 

Make sure to add to your input a "developer token" from GitHub and return the appropriate data for the scenario

List of Repositories should contain the following information:

      · Repo name

      · Repo size

      · Repo owner

Repo details should contain the following information:

     · Repo name

     · Repo size

     · Repo owner

     · Private\public repo

    · Number of files in the repo

    · Content of 1 yml file (anyone that appear in the repo)

    · Ative webhooks

Notes:
1. The system should be working as expected and convenient
2. Keep clean code and proper functionality
3. When scanning all 3 repo's at the same time limit your code to scan up to maximum 2 repo's in parallel 

Bonus:
Implement a client application to display the list of Repo's and the content of the repo once selected
